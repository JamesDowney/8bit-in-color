# 8bit-relay

## Installation:

```
git checkout loathers/8bit-relay
```

## Description:
This is a simple relay override for the revamped 8-bit Realm. It adds a bit of color to the locations so they match the Score indicator in KoL's default character pane, it adds an informational pane that tells you how your relevant stats compare to the maximum values needed for each location to maximize point gains, and it adds an obvious indicator for which zone is currently receiving a bonus.
